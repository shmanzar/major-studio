are licensed by the Province and are thoroughly capable in every respect. They gave us a history lesson that will be well remembered. I believe I  learned much more about Quebec than any town I have visited. There are so many things that are different and quaint, - it is a worthwhile place to visit. Everywhere the people were most courteous to us. If we asked a question and we were not understood (which was seldom), they would not leave us until they definitely found out what we wanted. On one occasion I was taken a block out of the way by a young man to a police officer who then directed me where I wanted to go. When offered a reward for his kindness he refused and thanked me for asking him and went about his way,- it seemed as if he was doing his civic duty. (P.S. He did accept an American cigarette though, as they are popular there. If you have been there you know why,-if not, ask someone).

    We next turned homeward with our Hudson Bay blankets and other knick-knacks that we had bought,- Oh Yes, save those sales slips as you can bring back into the U.S. one hundred dollars worth of duty free goods, but not having a loose hundred dollars you can see I had nothing to worry about. However it is still the best way to beat an argument if any. We reached the customs at Jackman, Maine and went through with no trouble.

   Coming into the State of Maine we moved along the Pine Tree Trail. It is as beautiful a bit of forest-land as can be seen anywhere and enough to hold your interest thoroughly.
  Evening brought us to our day's destination, - a little cottage on the road to Bar Harbor. A good night's rest made us ready and eager to eat almost anything including the tablecloth. The meal was excellent and I do remember the good whole milk and lovely rich cream . Our hostess explained that her husband ran a dairy. She was proud of her farm-products, and justly so.
   Our purpose in  going to Bar Harbor was to ascend Mt. Cadillac some 1532 Feet high. We had a perfect day for the view was clear and I made so many "filter shots" that I thought in the end my film would look like a meteorological survey but it came out well enough and the filters just cut the haze  enough to make a clear film. The tourists we met were pleasant and easy talkers. We exchanged views on many interesting subjects. Pleasant as it was we had to leave to continue our journey to Old Orchard our next stop. We made a mistake in the road and came in on the wrong side of town and got tied up in a race track crowd, - reminded me of Fifth Avenue. We arrived, notwithstanding, in time for dinner. We then went out to the boardwalk, had a pleasant stroll and enjoyed some of the amusements that were offered.
   The next morning we drove to a tourist camp that we had passed on the way, known as the Danish Village. The architecture had impressed me and I thought it would look good on film. The houses or cabins were built as they were in Denmark, with the crooked windows and doors,and with names over each house to give the impression that such people as Hans Christian Anderson and other famous Danes were

letting you their homes for the night. It is a swell idea and thhe place seemed to make you feel that you were not in the good old U. S. A., at least until you looked at the roadway that passed close by.

     Back in Old Orchard my companion, a venturesome young man, decided to go for a swim and tried to encourage me to accompany him but I am not of the hardy sort and decided against it but did go down to the beach with him.  After a dip and a few strokes he decided that there was something in my point of view and that he would save his swimming for later in the summer. 

     After two pleasant days here we were on our way to Portsmouth, N. H., arriving there in a few hours.  Spent a short time looking for the address where we were to stop.  We rolled up to Mrs. Blank's home where we met some friends who came in from New York and were just starting their vacation.  There is a quiet restful calm about the place that puts you in the mood for enjoying a rest, and if a man digs his grave with his teeth, as I have been told, I hope I can dig mine with Mrs. Blank's cooking.  In the evening it was nice to sit around and talk to Mr. Blank who had spent some of his younger years in the Navy.  I can assure you that you cannot lend your ear to a more absorbing story - teller. 

     The days passed there all too rapidly and before we knew it we were on our way home, and so to save for another year and I hope a longer and as pleasant a vacation.
